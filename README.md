🚀 Overview

The Smart Tourist Safety System is a web-based dashboard that helps keep travelers safe in unfamiliar locations.
It simulates live GPS tracking, AI-powered alerts, geo-fenced safe zones, SOS triggers, and incident reporting, all wrapped in a clean, responsive UI.

The project is designed as a prototype that can later be integrated with real GPS, backend services, and government/tourism authority systems.
